GDKPT - v 0.26

New Features
- favorite items are now persistent and saved through reloads and logouts.
- auction data is now persistent and saved through reloads and logouts.
- Added an Auction History. This History is local to the raids you participated in yourself.
- Auction History can be filtered based on character name and the specific item.
- added a new command: /gdkp macro , this opens a new frame where you can copy the macro text for
  mouseover favoriting items
- won items frame now automatically counts the amount of items you won in a raid and their average cost,
  ontop of total cost and Gold from Raid (total cost - cut)
- won auctions frame now has a button to show your personal auction history. This is equivalent
  to filtering the whole auction history by your own name, its just accessable with one click.
  This also lets you have your personal and the complete auction history up at the same time.


Quality of Life Changes
- Main Auction Window toggle button position is now properly saved and reloaded so it doesnt reset position between logsouts.
- optional frames FavoriteList, WonAuctions and AuctionHistory now properly stack on top of each other
- all optional frames can now be closed by pressing Escape
- GDKPT auction window toggle button now only shows while in a raid. You can still use 
  /gdkp show to show it at any time.


General
