GDKPT v0.39 Preview

- Fixed a bug that caused a lua error when mouse overing a bulk auction row while in 
  compact mode.
- Started working on a tutorial that can be called with /gdkp tutorial


GDKPT v0.38

New Features

- Added Bulk auction support to GDKPT.
- Leaders can use the new command /run GDKPT.RaidLeader.BulkAuction.ToggleItemInBulkList()
  to add/remove items to/from a bulk list. Starting an auction on the leaders' Hearthstone will
  then trigger a bulk auction to appear for all raid members, which includes all items that have
  gotten added to the bulk list. After starting an Hearthstone auction the toggled bulk list
  is automatically cleared.
- The new Bulk auction row has a special item texture and mousing over the row will tell you
  all of the items included in the bulk list, that the winner will receive.
- You can now filter auctions by item type. There are filters for cloth, leather, armor, plate,
  shields, offhands, jewelry, cloaks, and all weapon types. 
- You can additionally also filter auctions by Bind on Pickup or Bind on Equip.
- All auction filters can be combined with each other.
- GDKPT will now automatically reset all of your saved raid lockouts the very first time you log in
  every wednesday. There is a new setting to disable this feature.
- CooldownTracker: Instead of having all 5 category columns attached to one single background frame,
  there are now 5 separate columns that you can move seperately.
- CooldownTracker: Each category frame cooldown bars can be scaled seperately now.
- CooldownTracker: The position of each category frame is now saved through reloads and logouts.


Quality of Life Additions
- After winning an auction the addon will now tell you who to trade for your item
  and to use the AutoFill button to auto fill the gold amount into the trade window.
- CooldownTracker: Requesting a spell now also sends a chat message to the receiving player, either
  saying you want the spell NOW or in x seconds.
- Raidmembers will now receive a chat message after trading gold to the raid leader.
- When auction data is reset it now also resets the loot tracker.
- The RaidLeader addon will now show a warning when the leader wants to split the total pot
  and there is any offline player inside the raid. This is only a warning and does not block
  pot split functionality. Sometimes players have been offline for a long time and then they
  should most likely not receive a gold cut, but other times a player might need to leave very
  shortly before the pot split happens due to real life obligations. Its up to raidleaders
  to decide on the best way to handle these situations. If pot split is started with offline
  players in the raid then also these offline players are accounted for in the total pot divide.
- Bulk Item Toggle Macro has been added to /gdkp macros

General
- Removed a duplicate function from the auction filtering code.
- When the AuctionWindow is shown in either layout mode and you trade gold away, 
  the total gold amount text will now instantly update to the new remaining value.
- The code for force-splitting the gold pot has been removed since it should be no
  longer necessary and was causing bugs.
- Fixed a bug that made the LootTracker say that every single auctioned item went to the Bulk.
  Now it correctly states the winner and the winning bid.
- Reorderd macros in the /gdkp macros frame.
- Restructured, polished, improved and optimized alot of backend code.



GDKPT v0.37

This Update is only adressing issues and improvements for the Cooldown Tracker.
The next update will focus on issues and improvements for main GDKP functionalities.

New Features
- Flow of Life, Astral Plane, Heroism, Psychic Horror, Dismantle, Aura Mastery have been 
  added to the Cooldown Tracker.
- Added a Combat Log Mode, which is more performance - intensive but allows you
  track the cooldown of players who do not have the GDKPT addon. You can toggle it on in
  the Cooldown Tracker Menu. This is disabled by default.
- You can now assign a category for each tracked cooldown spell. There are categories A - E.
  Each category has their own column in the Cooldown Tracker, so you can adjust the layout
  in a way that you want to. By default spells are sorted into the 5 different categories like
  this: A - Offensive, B - Defensive, C - Healing, D - Mana, E - Utility 
- Added a function to reset all tracked cooldown spells to READY.
  This is useful for handling cooldown resets due to resetting a raid boss.
- Added an alpha slider to the main menu. This lets you customize the opacity of the all 
  cooldown bars.
- Added a Spell Request feature to the Cooldown Tracker. You can click on a cooldown bar in
  the Cooldown Tracker to send a spell - request to that specific player for that specific spell.
  The other player will see an Alert Text and a raidframe overlay for the requesting player.
  LeftClicking the bar tells the receiving player that you want the spell NOW.
  RightClicking the bar tells the receiving player that you want the spell in X seconds, 
  where X can be assigned in the main menu through a slider.
  Supported RaidFrame addons (Needs testing):
  Default Ascension RaidFrames, Grid2, VuhDo, ElvUI, ShadowedUnitFrames, oUF, XPerl
- Added a setting to disable incoming spell requests from other players.

Quality of Life Changes
- All Cooldown Tracker related settings, your prefered tracking mode, tracked spells and 
  assigned categories are now persistant through reloads, logouts and server crashes. 
- The config menu now has a button to reset all categories back to default.
- Added a button to the Cooldown Tracker menu for resetting all spells to READY.
- Using MouseButton 4 on the GDKPToggleButton now opens the Cooldown Tracker.
- Using MouseButton 5 on the GDKPToggleButton resets all spells to READY.
- There is a slider in the Cooldown Tracker menu to adjust the spell request Countdown time.
  For example, set the Countdown time to 5 seconds and the request-receiving player will see
  a 5 second countdown on raid overlay / alert text. It means that you want to receive that
  specific spell in 5 seconds. Slider ranges from 1 to 30 seconds.

General
- Fixed a bug that made Frenzied Regeneration not appear on the Cooldown Tracker.
- Fixed a bug that prevented size rescaling of the Cooldown Tracker. Click and Hold the drag
  button on the bottom right corner to resize the Cooldown Tracker bar scale.
  Not super happy with this yet, will improve in a future version.
- The GDKPToggleButton mouseover information has been adjusted to state MouseButton 4 and 5 behaviour.
- Fixed a bug that made the Select All and Deselect All buttons in the spell config menu not
  instantly update the shown cooldown spells in the Cooldown Tracker.


Updates to v0.37 changelog
- Innervate and Mana Tide Totem cooldown adjusted for combat log mode tracking 
- Fixed an issue that made assigned spell categories not properly persist through reloads and logouts
- cooldown bars now get filled from left to right instead of right to left
- when a spell is used, the background opacity gets reduced by half. As the timer progresses,
  the bar fill replenishes the background opacity

GDKPT v0.36

New Features
- Added a new setting: Show GDKPT auction history data on item tooltip, this is based on all of
  the raids you've joined. Shows the last 5 prices and an average over all of the prices. To
  remove any test data you can fully clear your auction history in the auction history panel.
- Added a new setting to enable playing a sound when winning an auction.
- The LootTracker has gotten alot of improvements:
  - LootTracker items are now persistant through server crashes.
  - You can now manually add items to the LootTracker based on itemIds, in case anything bugs out.
  - You can now filter items in the LootTracker by Tradeable, Auctioned, Has a Winner, Went to Bulk,
    Unauctioned.
  - You can now pre-bid on items within the LootTracker. Enter your pre-bid value and this value
    will be automatically added into your BidBox when the auction for this item starts.
    There is also a setting option to enable automatically sending your pre-bid shortly after
    an auction began. 
  - There is also a setting option to play a sound effect when an auction started that you did
    a pre-bid on. 
- The following spells have been added to the cooldown tracker:
  Barkskin, Survival Instincts, Frenzied Regen, Holy Shield, Last Stand

Quality of Life Changes
- If you request an auction resync mid-auctions the fix button to reenable the bid button and 
  bid box will properly appear now.
- Fully made cooldown tracker bars non-interactable.
- The winner auction overlay now only shows the bid price in gold and omits silver and copper.
- Moved the fix button in compact mode towards the rid of the bid button instead of the bid box.


General
- Found and resolved a critical trading bug that occurred in ItemTrading and PotSplit phase.
  The code for handling trade-cancels was also triggered on trade-completions and caused 
  wrong behaviours when trades have been cancelled during PotSplit trades, which resulted in
  the player balance of the person who traded after the cancelled - trade to not get properly
  adjusted. Basically, one person trading the leader after already having received their cut 
  bugged out the player balance of the person who is trading next in order to receive their cut.
  This bug has caused raidleaders to lose X-times the cut as gold per raid, where X is the amount 
  of times players accidently traded the leader during pot split trades.
  Needs testing before next raid, no GDKPT addon update needed.
- Added a new Easter Egg (or maybe more).
- Your average item cost in your personal player history panel is no longer bugging out when
  you have won 0 items so far.


GDKPT - v 0.35 Part 1

New Features
- Added functionalities for auctioning items off from loot windows (creature corpses).
  Typing /gdkpleader loot brings up the list of items that can be auctioned off with their slots.
  Typing /gdkpleader loot X where X is the slot ID auctions of that items from the corpse.
- Added a Raid Data Snapshot system to the RaidLeader version. Leaders can now save data from
  a raid and load this dataset at any later point to create proper Data Exports for previous raids.
  This works for CSV, Text, JSON and Screenshot Exports. 
- Added a new RaidLeader UI for managing Raid Data Snapshots as well as Snapshot Unloading.
- There is now a raid-wide cooldown tracker built into GDKPT. Type /gdkp cd to open the 
  cooldown tracker, it gets auto populated when a player in a raid
  running GDKPT uses a cooldown spell. Currently implemented spells: 
  innervate, efflorscence, rebirth, tranqulity, ice block, mass invisibility, misdirection, divine
  sacrifice, hand of salvation, hand of protection, divine hymn, hymn of hope, pain suppression,
  guardian spirit, halo, power word: barrier, tricks of the trade, smoke bomb, earth elemental totem,
  mana tide totem, bloodlust, shield wall, disarm.
  Let me know if there are more spells that should get added.
- You can customize and filter the spells you see in the Cooldown Tracker through a Config menu.
- The LootTracker now shows when an auction for a specific item has started and who won the auction. 

Quality of Life Changes
- Added a tooltip to the GDKPToggleButton that appears on mouseover. It explains how you can open
  the two different panels and that you can move the button by holding leftclick.

General
- The RaidLeaders' TradeHelper now correctly checks for Corpse-Auctioned items as they have never
  been inside of the RaidLeaders' inventory.
- Fixed a bug regarding Pot Split Trades that could occur when a player left the raid after all
  auctions have been done but before the pot split was finalized.
- Fixed a bug that made manually hidden auction rows (through right-click on an auction row) 
  reappear when an auction ends.
- The LootTracker updates now only once per minute instead of once per second, this should improve
  fps.
- Fixed a bug that disabled the BidButton and BidBox on re-syncing auctions mid-auctioning.

Known Quirks:
- the cooldown tracker needs to be opened atleast once before it can properly track raid member
  cooldowns. So type /gdkp cd once at the start and thats enough.


GDKPT - v0.35 Part 2

- Added a new menu to adjust the Cooldown Tracker and test it with 50 simulated cooldowns.
- Continued to improve addon performance, documentation and structure.
- Fixed a bug that only appended the itemlink on an auction row with the stack count when a bid is received
  instead of on auction start.
- Fixed a bug that made won items no longer appear in the my won auctions frame.
- You can now right-click the ToggleButton to switch to a more compact design of the Auction Window.
- Cooldown bars within the Cooldown Tracker now have a class-based background.
- Fixed a bug that allowed you to repeatedly spam the Fill with Test Data button on the
  Cooldown Tracker and crash your own game.
- Compact mode now has a compact bottom info panel.
- You can now scale the size of the cooldown bars inside the cooldown tracker with the Drag button
  in the bottom right corner.




GDKPT - v 0.34

New Features
- Added a Fix button, that appears when the bid button is getting stuck on Syncing...
- After you placed a bid on any auction, there is now an internal timer running. 
  Every 5 seconds this is checking if your bid button is stuck on Syncing..., and if it is, 
  then it shows a small Fix button to the right that you can click to immediately unstuck yourself. 
  Timer stops running when an auction ends.

Quality of Life Changes
- There is now a small delay between Auction Resets and GDKPT UI refresh to ensure everything
  resets properly for everyone
- After a reset there is now an automatic re-sync
- Current Cut on the Bottom Info Panel now always shows the amount of players the gold is split by

General
- Fixed a bug that caused alot of Invalid Item Link chat messages when the masterlooter is 
  looting multiple items at once and the addon is trying to add these to the LootTracker
- Fixed a bug that caused alot of Sync Pot - Total Pot - Current Cut chat message spam
- The RaidLeader Addon is now validating late bids first before validating the amount, this
  should help make the stuck on Syncing... bug less common.
- Fixed a bug that made auctions sometimes not respect the new timer cap system.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the PendingAuctions table from getting properly cleaned up on 
  AuctionEnd



GDKPT - v 0.33

New Features
- Added an internal ItemHash system to better deal with duplicate items which previously caused
  alot of issues.

Quality of Life Changes
- Standardized every single [GDKPT] print message

- Every single [GDKPT] print message should now be more clear and informative.

  the itemlink
- Added a new setting to hide the GDKPT Toggle Button while in combat
- GDKPT functionalities will now only work while in a raid with the raidleader running
  the GDKPT RaidLeader addon. Let me know if I missed disabling anything while not in a GDKP.
- Items, which are not Soulbound or Bind on Pickup, now show Tradeable/BoE instead of the 2 hour
  trade timer when added to the Loot Tracker through the Auto MasterLoot system



General
- Fully reworked the RaidLeader version of the addon. (~15k lines of code restructured and refactored)
- Fully rewrote the RaidLeader's Message Handler system, addon communication should be much faster 
  now and the bidButton - stuck - on - sync bug should be way less common in 25 man raids.
  Needs testing to see if its fully fixed now.
- Fully reworked the Manual Adjustment system
- Fully reworked Trading during item/gold & pot-split trades.
- Added an Easter Egg.
- Fixed a bug that made the My Bids tracker in the bottom right corner not properly track bids
  from auctions that have ended
- Fixed a bug that re-enabled the BidButton and the BidBox after an auction has ended if another
  player has requested a setting/auction sync at the exact moment any auction is completed
- Increased the delay between sending Auto Masterloot messages to the raidmember addon to hopefully
  make the loot tracker show all looted items and not get overwhelmed by 9 items at once
- If multiple players click the bidButton on the same auction at almost the exact time (less than 0.5 sec difference),
  then the second players' bid will be invalid. Previously this caused the bidButton to be stuck on Syncing...
  This should be fixed now, the bidButton will be reenabled for the second player.
- Fixed a bug that allowed raidleaders to assign invalid auction durations, extra time, starting bids or min increments.
- Fixed a bug that was still sending raid chat messages if the raidleader set an invalid auction duration.

- Alot of internal code restructuring, optimization and documentation for both member and leader addons


Updates to v 0.33
- AutoFill button is now situative responsive, based on whether you need to pay up, you are fully
  paid up or will receive gold from the leader.
- Raidmember addon is no longer tracking balances. Instead, on trade open with the raidleader
  the current balance for the specific player is getting synced.

- Fixed a bug that printed the wrong error message when bid cap was removed
- Reworked the AutoPlacer to use the new double itemhash system in preparations for the
  ascension item trade bug fix
- Fixed a bug that would only add the Cut to players who have won an auction. It now properly adds
  the cut to every member in the raid.

  players in a raid changes
- Adjusted the positioning of buttons in the top panel


GDKPT - v 0.32

New Feature
- New Timer Cap feature: Auction duration can no longer exceed the maximum auction duration specified by the raidleader.
  If the auction duration drops below half of the maximum duration of an auction, then this half becomes the new timer cap
  for the auction. Example: 60 sec max duration, bids happening between 31 and 59 seconds left
  will only bring the auction duration up to at most 60 seconds. Once the timer drops below 30 seconds, bids can only bring 
  the timer up to 30 seconds.
- New Loot Tracker: Whenever the masterlooter loots an item, this item gets placed into the Loot Tracker.
  If an item drops multiple times in a raid then the loot tracker shows x2, x3,...
- New Bid Cap System: You can now limit your bids across all auctions by a specified amount. This is tracked
  across all auctions. Example: You limit yourself by 100 gold, then you can bid 50 gold on auction 1, 25 gold
  on auction 2 and 25 gold on auction 3, but cannot do any further bids on any other auction until you increase 
  your own bid cap. Leave the input field empty for bid cap.


Quality of Life Changes
- Loot Tracker frame is now scaleable with the button on the bottom right corner

- the bottom info panel now shows the total sum of all your bids

General
- fully reworked the bottom info panel
- fully rewrote item trading logic and pot split trade code, might be better now
- lots of layout improvements
- alot of internal code restructuring, optimization and documentation
- Fixed a bug that made bids occuring too late still send a raid message. The raid message is now being
  printed when the raid leader validated the incoming bid as correct



GDKPT - v 0.31
- more code cleanup for beta version

GDKPT - v 0.30
- Code Cleanup in preparations for beta version


GDKPT - v 0.29

New Features
- Added export functionality to export all auctions from this raid as plain text, CSV, JSON or
  into two Screenshot - frames where you can select the auction rows to screenshot 
- Added an AutoFill button, that automatically fills the total cost of all won auctions into the trade window
  while trading with the raidleader in a GDKP
- This Autofill button is data persistant, meaning if you e.g. won an auction at 50 gold, then trade the leader to
  autofill 50 gold and get your item, and then win another auction at 100 gold afterwards, the second trade window
  autofill click will only add the remaining 100 gold. 
- Trade data is now load persistant, meaning if you reload or relog mid-auctions and have already paid for the items
  of a previous auction, you now auto sync up when trading the raidleader to only ever pay the missing amount of 
  unpaid - auctions
- RaidLeader feature: Auto place all won items into the trade window when a player is trading you and that player
  has won auctions. This also works through multiple stacks of items which need to be split up into multiple trades
  due to the 6 item per trade limit.
- RaidLeader feature: Pot Split - when all players have received their items and paid the item costs, then a button becomes
  available to initiate a Pot Split - the total pot divided by the specified player amount will be added to every raidmembers
  balance in the leader frame.
- Added AutoFill for RaidLeader Pot-Split-Trades: Auto Fills the current cut into the trade window when trading with a player
  who still needs to receive their cut.
- Added Double-Cut-Trade-Protection: If a player has already received their cut and initiates a trade again, the trade window 
  will auto close and a raid message will ask the player to please not double trade for their cut. One cut per player.
- More customization settings have been added.

Quality of Life Changes

- Added Macro Code to /gdkp macro for clicking the AutoFill button for raidmembers.
- Added a setting for the AutoFill button to also AcceptTrades on second useage.
  First AutoFill click fills the gold amount, Second Autofill Click clicks the Trade button to accept the trade.
  This also works for the macro, so press the macro once to fill the gold, and a second time to accept trade.
  This is OFF by default and needs to be turned on in the settings.  

General

- General code cleanup, frame visual improvements and smaller bugfixes in preparation for the 0.3 BETA phase


GDKPT - v 0.28

New Features
- More General, Bidding and Favorite related settings have been added. These choices
  persist through logouts and reloads.
- Added a visual indicator that will hopefully make players click the Synchronize Auctions button
  when their auctions are out of sync
- Added pot split functionality so RaidLeader can easily distribute gold in the end of a raid.
- Added an AutoFill button. If you have the functionality for this button enabled in your settings,
  then pressing the button will autofill the gold cost from auctions when you're trading with the
  raidleader. If you also have the Auto Accept functionality enabled, the AutoFill button will also
  automatically accept the trade. If you are the first person to accept trade, you will need to 
  press this button twice to get a permanent trade accept. If your trade partner has already clicked
  the Trade button to confirm the trade, you only need to press the AutoFill button once.
- Added pot history for raidleaders.
- Auctions now show 'Ending soon...' when they are less than 3 seconds away from ending, instead
  of the actual timer. This is to account for latency delays, especially for ascension servers.
  The auction timer is shown on your local time, which may be off by 1-2 seconds compared to the
  raidleaders time. Only the raidleaders' time matters for auction endings.
- Added more color changes as the auction timer gets lower.
- Leftclicking the info button on the top left now lets you synchronize auction settings again. 
  Rightclicking the info button lets you synchronize all active auctions. 



Quality of Life Changes
- Raidleader toggle UI frames button is no longer hidden on leftclick or rightclick
- Favorited item auctions now always show on top when filtering the auction table by favorites
- Added a macro to simulate an AutoFill button click. You will either need to press it once or twice,
  see above.
- /gdkp macro now opens a macro selection window where you can select the favorite-item-on-mouseover or
   gdkp trademacro text to copy

General

- When the masterlooter has looted an item that you have favorited, then there will be 
  a chat message, a small frame popping up for 3 seconds, and a custom sound being played.
  Any of these (chat message, frame pop up, sound) can be adjusted in settings in a future update.
  Sound can be customized by simply replacing the sound file.
- Leader Addon: Added Player Gold Balance tracking
- Leader Addon: Added Manual Gold Balance Adjustments. This also updates everyones values instantly
  and sends a raid chat message to let everyone know a manual adjustment happened. All visual bugs
  based on manual adjustments have been fixed. Auction rows will now show MANUALLY ADJUSTED if they have
  been manually adjusted by the raidleader
- currently active auctions now persist through reloads and logouts.
- after reload, opening the main GDKPT window has a button to request currently updated auction settings,
