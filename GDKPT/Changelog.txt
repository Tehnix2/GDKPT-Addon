GDKPT - v 0.33

New Features
- Added an internal ItemHash system to better deal with duplicate items which previously caused
  alot of issues.

Quality of Life Changes
- Standardized every single [GDKPT] print message
- Standardized every single [GDKPT RaidLeader] print message
- Every single [GDKPT] print message should now be more clear and informative.
- Resyncing auctions now respects your choice of display settings
- Manual Adjustments can now be selected with Up/Down Keyboard buttons and the RaidLeader no longer needs to specify
  auction prices or auction IDs
- Item tooltips now also show when mouse overing the item texture on a row, in addition to mouseovering
  the itemlink
- Added a new setting to hide the GDKPT Toggle Button while in combat
- GDKPT functionalities will now only work while in a raid with the raidleader running
  the GDKPT RaidLeader addon. Let me know if I missed disabling anything while not in a GDKP.



General
- Fully reworked the RaidLeader version of the addon. (~15k lines of code restructured and refactored)
- Fully rewrote the RaidLeader's Message Handler system, addon communication should be much faster 
  now and the bidButton - stuck - on - sync bug should be way less common in 25 man raids.
  Needs testing to see if its fully fixed now.
- Fully reworked the Manual Adjustment system
- Fully reworked Trading during item/gold & pot-split trades.
- Added an Easter Egg.
- Fixed a bug that made the My Bids tracker in the bottom right corner not properly track bids
  from auctions that have ended
- Fixed a bug that re-enabled the BidButton and the BidBox after an auction has ended if another
  player has requested a setting/auction sync at the exact moment any auction is completed
- Increased the delay between sending Auto Masterloot messages to the raidmember addon to hopefully
  make the loot tracker show all looted items and not get overwhelmed by 9 items at once
- If multiple players click the bidButton on the same auction at almost the exact time (less than 0.5 sec difference),
  then the second players' bid will be invalid. Previously this caused the bidButton to be stuck on Syncing...
  This should be fixed now, the bidButton will be reenabled for the second player.
- Fixed a bug that allowed raidleaders to assign invalid auction durations, extra time, starting bids or min increments.
- Fixed a bug that was still sending raid chat messages if the raidleader set an invalid auction duration.
- Fixed a bug that was still sending raid chat messages if the raidleader set an invalid auction exra time per bid.
- Fixed a bug that was still sending raid chat messages if the raidleader set an invalid starting bid for auctions.
- Fixed a bug that was still sending raid chat messages if the raidleader set an invalid minimum increment for auctions.
- Fixed a bug that caused auction rows to appear in a wrong order after resyncing auctions after a reload.
- Alot of internal code restructuring, optimization and documentation for both member and leader addons



GDKPT - v 0.32

New Feature
- New Timer Cap feature: Auction duration can no longer exceed the maximum auction duration specified by the raidleader.
  If the auction duration drops below half of the maximum duration of an auction, then this half becomes the new timer cap
  for the auction. Example: 60 sec max duration, bids happening between 31 and 59 seconds left
  will only bring the auction duration up to at most 60 seconds. Once the timer drops below 30 seconds, bids can only bring 
  the timer up to 30 seconds.
- New Loot Tracker: Whenever the masterlooter loots an item, this item gets placed into the Loot Tracker.
  If an item drops multiple times in a raid then the loot tracker shows x2, x3,...
- New Bid Cap System: You can now limit your bids across all auctions by a specified amount. This is tracked
  across all auctions. Example: You limit yourself by 100 gold, then you can bid 50 gold on auction 1, 25 gold
  on auction 2 and 25 gold on auction 3, but cannot do any further bids on any other auction until you increase 
  your own bid cap. Leave the input field empty for bid cap.


Quality of Life Changes
- Loot Tracker frame is now scaleable with the button on the bottom right corner
- You can now favorite items from the loot tracker by clicking the star icon

  Show All option from the filters in the top left corner
- Added a new setting to automatically hide finished auctions 5 seconds after completion
- the bottom info panel now shows the total sum of all your bids

General
- fully reworked the bottom info panel
- fully rewrote item trading logic and pot split trade code, might be better now
- lots of layout improvements
- alot of internal code restructuring, optimization and documentation
- Fixed a bug that made bids occuring too late still send a raid message. The raid message is now being
  printed when the raid leader validated the incoming bid as correct



GDKPT - v 0.31
- more code cleanup for beta version

GDKPT - v 0.30
- Code Cleanup in preparations for beta version


GDKPT - v 0.29

New Features
- Added export functionality to export all auctions from this raid as plain text, CSV, JSON or
  into two Screenshot - frames where you can select the auction rows to screenshot 
- Added an AutoFill button, that automatically fills the total cost of all won auctions into the trade window
  while trading with the raidleader in a GDKP
- This Autofill button is data persistant, meaning if you e.g. won an auction at 50 gold, then trade the leader to
  autofill 50 gold and get your item, and then win another auction at 100 gold afterwards, the second trade window
  autofill click will only add the remaining 100 gold. 
- Trade data is now load persistant, meaning if you reload or relog mid-auctions and have already paid for the items
  of a previous auction, you now auto sync up when trading the raidleader to only ever pay the missing amount of 
  unpaid - auctions
- RaidLeader feature: Auto place all won items into the trade window when a player is trading you and that player
  has won auctions. This also works through multiple stacks of items which need to be split up into multiple trades
  due to the 6 item per trade limit.
- RaidLeader feature: Pot Split - when all players have received their items and paid the item costs, then a button becomes
  available to initiate a Pot Split - the total pot divided by the specified player amount will be added to every raidmembers
  balance in the leader frame.
- Added AutoFill for RaidLeader Pot-Split-Trades: Auto Fills the current cut into the trade window when trading with a player
  who still needs to receive their cut.
- Added Double-Cut-Trade-Protection: If a player has already received their cut and initiates a trade again, the trade window 
  will auto close and a raid message will ask the player to please not double trade for their cut. One cut per player.
- More customization settings have been added.

Quality of Life Changes

- Added Macro Code to /gdkp macro for clicking the AutoFill button for raidmembers.
- Added a setting for the AutoFill button to also AcceptTrades on second useage.
  First AutoFill click fills the gold amount, Second Autofill Click clicks the Trade button to accept the trade.
  This also works for the macro, so press the macro once to fill the gold, and a second time to accept trade.
  This is OFF by default and needs to be turned on in the settings.  

General

- General code cleanup, frame visual improvements and smaller bugfixes in preparation for the 0.3 BETA phase


GDKPT - v 0.28

New Features
- More General, Bidding and Favorite related settings have been added. These choices
  persist through logouts and reloads.
- Added a visual indicator that will hopefully make players click the Synchronize Auctions button
  when their auctions are out of sync
- Added pot split functionality so RaidLeader can easily distribute gold in the end of a raid.
- Added an AutoFill button. If you have the functionality for this button enabled in your settings,
  then pressing the button will autofill the gold cost from auctions when you're trading with the
  raidleader. If you also have the Auto Accept functionality enabled, the AutoFill button will also
  automatically accept the trade. If you are the first person to accept trade, you will need to 
  press this button twice to get a permanent trade accept. If your trade partner has already clicked
  the Trade button to confirm the trade, you only need to press the AutoFill button once.
- Added pot history for raidleaders.
- Auctions now show 'Ending soon...' when they are less than 3 seconds away from ending, instead
  of the actual timer. This is to account for latency delays, especially for ascension servers.
  The auction timer is shown on your local time, which may be off by 1-2 seconds compared to the
  raidleaders time. Only the raidleaders' time matters for auction endings.
- Added more color changes as the auction timer gets lower.
- Leftclicking the info button on the top left now lets you synchronize auction settings again. 
  Rightclicking the info button lets you synchronize all active auctions. 



Quality of Life Changes
- Raidleader toggle UI frames button is no longer hidden on leftclick or rightclick
- Favorited item auctions now always show on top when filtering the auction table by favorites

   gdkp trademacro text to copy

  Any of these (chat message, frame pop up, sound) can be adjusted in settings in a future update.
  Sound can be customized by simply replacing the sound file.
- Leader Addon: Added Player Gold Balance tracking
- Leader Addon: Added Manual Gold Balance Adjustments. This also updates everyones values instantly
  and sends a raid chat message to let everyone know a manual adjustment happened. All visual bugs
  based on manual adjustments have been fixed. Auction rows will now show MANUALLY ADJUSTED if they have
  been manually adjusted by the raidleader
- currently active auctions now persist through reloads and logouts.
- after reload, opening the main GDKPT window has a button to request currently updated auction settings,
