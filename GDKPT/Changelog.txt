GDKPT - v 0.29

- Added export functionality to export all auctions from this raid as plain text, CSV, JSON or
  into two Screenshot - frames where you can select the auction rows to screenshot 
- lots of code cleanup


GDKPT - v 0.28

New Features
- More General, Bidding and Favorite related settings have been added. These choices
  persist through logouts and reloads.
- Added a visual indicator that will hopefully make players click the Synchronize Auctions button
  when their auctions are out of sync
- Added pot split functionality so RaidLeader can easily distribute gold in the end of a raid.
- Added an AutoFill button. If you have the functionality for this button enabled in your settings,
  then pressing the button will autofill the gold cost from auctions when you're trading with the
  raidleader. If you also have the Auto Accept functionality enabled, the AutoFill button will also
  automatically accept the trade. If you are the first person to accept trade, you will need to 
  press this button twice to get a permanent trade accept. If your trade partner has already clicked
  the Trade button to confirm the trade, you only need to press the AutoFill button once.
- Added pot history for raidleaders.
- Auctions now show 'Ending soon...' when they are less than 3 seconds away from ending, instead
  of the actual timer. This is to account for latency delays, especially for ascension servers.
  The auction timer is shown on your local time, which may be off by 1-2 seconds compared to the
  raidleaders time. Only the raidleaders' time matters for auction endings.
- Added more color changes as the auction timer gets lower.
- Leftclicking the info button on the top left now lets you synchronize auction settings again. 
  Rightclicking the info button lets you synchronize all active auctions. 



Quality of Life Changes
- Raidleader toggle UI frames button is no longer hidden on leftclick or rightclick
- Favorited item auctions now always show on top when filtering the auction table by favorites
- Added a macro to simulate an AutoFill button click. You will either need to press it once or twice,
  see above.
- /gdkp macro now opens a macro selection window where you can select the favorite-item-on-mouseover or
   gdkp trademacro text to copy

General
- Hopefully fixed a bug that caused auction rows to show up without an item.

- Re-syncing auctions after a reload/relog now also properly adjusts the PlayerBalance table for
